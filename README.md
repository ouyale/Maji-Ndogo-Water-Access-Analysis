# üíß Maji Ndogo Water Access Dashboard  
*A Power BI Storytelling Project Designed for Decision-Making*

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to help national and provincial leaders in the fictional country of **Maji Ndogo** understand:
- How water is accessed across regions  
- Who lacks access to basic water  
- What infrastructure improvements are needed  
- How much funding is required, and how it's distributed

## üë• User Stories That Shaped This Dashboard

### üü¶ 1. **President Naledi (National Decision-Maker)**  
> ‚ÄúI need to understand the scale of the water challenge, where we need to intervene, how much it will cost, and what outcomes to expect.‚Äù

Her page includes:
- A breakdown of population vs. access across provinces  
- Urban vs. rural comparisons  
- National improvement needs and their projected costs  
- A **bookmark toggle** to switch between budget views: by province or by improvement type  
- Summary cards showing total cost, % of population with basic water access, and a map of Maji Ndogo 

### üü™ 2. **Provincial Leaders (Localised Decision-Makers)**  
> ‚ÄúI need to see the situation in my province ‚Äî the budget needed, towns affected, and types of improvements required.‚Äù

Each province page (Sokoto, Kilimani, Akatsi, Amanzi, Hawassa) includes:
- Town-level improvement counts and budgets  
- Cost per citizen  
- Budget allocation by improvement type  
- Urban/rural budget splits  
- Drill-through connections from the national overview

## Tools & Capabilities Applied  

### Power BI Techniques
- Bookmark toggles for intuitive navigation  
- Custom **DAX measures** for:
  - Rural-adjusted infrastructure costs  
  - Classification of water sources into basic or below-basic  
  - Budgeted improvement cost per source  
  - Percentage of the population with basic water access  
- Aggregated transformation of improvement types  
- Conditional filters and interactivity across pages  

### Design Principles
- Clear 3-part layout: **Who needs help ‚Üí What needs to be done ‚Üí How much it will cost**  
- Modular design across tabs for each user role  
- Colour-coded visuals for clarity without distraction  
- Tooltips and annotations to explain reclassified data fields

## üí° What I Learned  

The project gave me practice in:
- Creating visuals that align with stakeholder questions  
- Using calculated columns and measures to tell a data story  
- Simplifying complex data flows into actionable insights  
- Iterating with purpose, making the dashboard cleaner and more intuitive with every pass
